                At our website, we use cookies to enhance your browsing
                experience and provide you with personalized content and
                services. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your
                computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They help
                the website remember your preferences, settings, and login
                information, and provide you with a more seamless experience.

                We use several types of cookies on our website, including
                session cookies, persistent cookies, and third-party cookies.
                Session cookies are temporary cookies that are deleted when you
                close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your
                device for a set period of time. Third-party cookies are placed
                by a third-party service provider, such as Google Analytics, to
                collect data about your browsing behavior and provide analytics
                to help us improve our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our use of cookies and third-party scripts is in accordance with
                our Privacy Policy, which outlines how we collect, use, and
                protect your personal information. We only collect data that is
                necessary to provide you with the best possible user experience
                and to improve our website's performance.

            <p>
                Google Analytics is one third-party script that we use on our
                website. It helps us to understand how visitors use our site,
                such as which pages are visited most frequently and for how
                long. This data is used to improve our website's functionality
                and content. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect
                information about your browsing behavior, including your IP
                address and the pages you visit on our website. This information
                is stored on Google's servers and may be shared with other
                Google services.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not want Google Analytics to collect data about your
                browsing behavior, you can opt-out by installing the Google
                Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. The add-on prevents Google
                Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from
                sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to Google Analytics, we may also use other
                third-party scripts and services on our website, such as social
                media plugins and advertising networks. These scripts may also
                use cookies to collect data about your browsing behavior and may
                share this information with other third-party services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, our use of cookies and third-party scripts is designed
                to improve your browsing experience and provide you with
                personalized content and services. We take your privacy
                seriously and will only collect data that is necessary to
                provide you with the best possible user experience. If you have
                any questions or concerns about our use of cookies or
                third-party scripts, please contact us through our website.
